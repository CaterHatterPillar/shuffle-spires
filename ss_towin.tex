\subsection{Winning \textbf{Shuffle-Spires}}
\label{sec:winningshufflespires}
\textbf{Shuffle-Spires} is a game about \textit{attempting} to predict the chaos the storm and winds have wrought upon the Kings of Thin, their Legendary Spires and their plan for Realm-Domination.

The objective in \textbf{Shuffle-Spires} is to be the sole surviving King of Thin (and thereof the ruler of the Realm of Thin-Things).
That is; to keep oneâ€™s top section (King) from being destroyed for as long as possible.
